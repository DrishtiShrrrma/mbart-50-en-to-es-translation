Observations:

1. The variation in weight decay doesn't seem to significantly affect the metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) across the epochs. The results are relatively close to each other.
2. Training and evaluation times vary somewhat across different weight decay values. However, the difference is within a few minutes, so it might not be a significant factor for choosing one weight decay over another.
3. All configurations appear to have a slight increase in the metrics from Epoch 1 to Epoch 4.
4. The BLEU score and the Rouge metrics seem to plateau or slightly increase by the 4th epoch in all configurations.

Recommendations:

1. If training time is a critical factor, you might want to choose the configuration that trains faster. In this case, the weight decay of 1e-1 seems to be a bit faster.
2. If you want the best performance based on the metrics, the configuration with weight decay 1e-1 at Epoch 4 seems to have the highest scores among all.
3. If you're going to train for more epochs, it would be interesting to see if the metrics continue to improve or if they start to plateau or degrade.

Remember, while these metrics provide a quantitative measure of the model's performance, it's also essential to consider qualitative evaluations (e.g., human evaluation) to understand the real-world applicability of the trained model.
